Several example programs are provided in the Examples/SDI directory
and are described below.


Capture
-------

NAME
	capture, mcapture - example SMPTE 259M-C receiver application

SYNOPSIS
	capture [OPTION]... DEVICE_FILE

	mcapture [OPTION]... DEVICE_FILE

DESCRIPTION
	Capture reads data from DEVICE_FILE
	and writes it to standard output,
	while monitoring for SMPTE 259M-C receiver events.

	Mcapture uses mmap instead of read.

OPTIONS
	-h
		Display a help message and quit.
	-n TIME
		Stop after TIME seconds.
	-V
		Display the version information and quit.

bitrate
------

NAME
	bitrate - example HD-SDI receiver application

SYNOPSIS
	bitrate [OPTION]... DEVICE_FILE [FILE]

DESCRIPTION
	bitrate reads data from DEVICE_FILE
	and optionally writes the received data to FILE.
	If FILE is not specified, the data is discarded.

	Any events which are reported by the receiver are
	sent to standard output, unless the -q option is used.

	If the -s option is used, bitrate will periodically display
	the bitrate between it and the driver.

OPTIONS

	-h
		Display a help message and quit.

	-p PID
		Count packets with the given PID.
	-q
		Quiet operation; no output.
	-s PERIOD
		Display status every PERIOD seconds.
	-v
		Verbose output; display additional information
		at startup.
	-V
		Display the version information and quit.


Playout
-------

NAME
	playout, mplayout - example SMPTE 259M-C transmitter application

SYNOPSIS
	playout [OPTION]... DEVICE_FILE

	mplayout [OPTION]... DEVICE_FILE

DESCRIPTION
	Playout reads data from standard input and writes it to DEVICE_FILE,
	while monitoring for SMPTE 259M-C transmitter events.

	At end-of-file, playout issues a fsync () to the interface.

	Mplayout uses mmap instead of write.

OPTIONS
	-h
		Display a help message and quit.
	-n TIME
		Stop after TIME seconds.
	-V
		Display the version information and quit.


Sdicfg
------

NAME
	sdicfg - configure a SMPTE 259M-C interface

SYNOPSIS
	sdicfg [OPTION]... DEVICE_FILE

DESCRIPTION
	Sdicfg uses the sysfs virtual filesystem to configure certain parameters
	of a SMPTE 259M-C interface. If no options are given, sdicfg
	displays the current configuration of the interface.

OPTIONS
	-b BUFFERS
		Set the number of driver buffers on DEVICE_FILE to BUFFERS.
		There must be at least two buffers.
	-h
		Display a help message and quit.
	-m MODE
		Set the operating mode of DEVICE_FILE to MODE.
		Possible values are
		0 (8-bit precision),
		1 (pack four 10-bit words into five bytes).
	-s BUFSIZE
		Set the size of the driver buffers on DEVICE_FILE to
		BUFSIZE bytes. This must be a positive multiple of four.
	-V
		Display the version information and quit.
	-x CLKSRC
		Set the clock source of DEVICE_FILE to CLKSRC.
		This is valid only for transmitters.
		Possible values are
		0 (onboard oscillator),
		1 (external reference clock),
		2 (recovered receive clock).

hdsdicfg
--------

NAME
	hdsdicfg - configure a SMPTE 274M interface

SYNOPSIS
	hdsdicfg [OPTION]---DEVICE_FILE

DESCRIPTION
	hdsdicfg uses the sysfs virtual filesystem to configure certain parameters
	of a SMPTE 274M interface. If no options are given, hdsdicfg
	displays the current configuration of the interface.

OPTIONS
	-b BUFFERS    set the number of buffers
  	-h display this help and exit
  	-m MODE set the operating mode
  	-s BUFSIZE set the buffer size
  	-V output version information and exit
  	-x CLKSRC set the clock source


Sdirxcfg
--------

NAME
	sdirxcfg - interactively issue SMPTE 259M-C receiver ioctls

SYNOPSIS
	sdirxcfg [OPTION]... DEVICE_FILE

DESCRIPTION
	Sdirxcfg is a simple program which demonstrates
	the SMPTE 259M-C receiver ioctl commands.
	It can be used interactively to control or monitor
	a SMPTE 259M-C receiver, or noninteractively
	with a script piped to its standard input.

OPTIONS
	-h
		Display a help message and quit.
	-V
		Display the version information and quit.
