How to use cpraster
-------------------

In order to make raster updates easier, you can use a utility named cpraster,
which creates a userdef.ref file from all raster files found in a directory.
Copy all raster files into the same directory where the cpraster tool is placed.
This should be <sdk dir>/<os>/driver/ref. Executing the cpraster utility will
create a new userdef.ref in the driver directory <sdk dir>/<os>/driver .

If there already is a userdef.ref file in your driver directory, copy this file
into the 'ref' directory too, before executing cpraster. This way, the old ref
file and the additional ref files will be merged into a new userdef.ref.

The old userdef.ref file in the driver directory will always be overwritten!

NOTE: If the old userdef.ref already includes the same rasters as are available
in separate *.ref files, the rasters will appear two times in the new
userdef.ref which may lead to unpredictable results. You may check this using
'cpraster -l <ref-file>' .

The cpraster utility will not take rasters from
<sdk dir>/<os>/driver/userdef.ref . The file driver/userdef.ref is only
overwritten but never read.
