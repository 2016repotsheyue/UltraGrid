Compiling from source code

   The UltraGrid system depends on modified versions of Tcl-8.0 and Tk-8.0
   which should be included in the distribution. It will not work correctly
   with the standard Tcl/Uk versions.

   On Unix like systems, you should build the tcl-8.0 and tk-8.0 packages
   before trying to build UltraGrid:

	cd ../tcl-8.0/unix
	./configure
	make
	cd ../../tk-8.0/unix
	./configure
	make

   Once this is complete, return to this directory and compile the
   UltraGrid system:

	./configure
	make

   This will detect the characteristics of the build host, compile the
   system, and run a number of tests. The resulting binary will be the 
   file "bin/uv".
